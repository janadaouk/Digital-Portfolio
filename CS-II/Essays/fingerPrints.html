      <p>      What if I said that websites, like humans have unique fingerprints. Yes, humans aren't special. We've all heard of the covid-19 virus, most of us have even endured its consequences. So, does a computer virus or hack work the same way and what could be its virtual vaccine? As a rule of life, one doesn't give anyone their social security number or credit card information. It is done thoughtlessly, but why? As hard as it is to believe, not everyone wants the best for you. This information must be secure. Every wesite starts with the tedious "hhtp", but recently many companies have shifted to using "https" instead. That extra 's' provides a layer of security to which many aren't aware. The two primary purposes of a <b> secure </b>, HTTPS connection include the safe transfer of information online by encrypting the data when its being transfered and the allowing only the rightful recieving end to be able to decrypt it (Shields UP!! System Error, n.d). This also assures the user to trust this new way of life, leading to an increasing dependency on software systems. This saves many tedious costs like offices, office supplies...
</p>

<p>	  It is expected that when you put in your sensitive information, that it will be securely transfered, but what if it isn't? The 'FBI agent watching your phone' may be real. An HTTPS proxy appliance is a third party acting in between the client/user and the server. Neither of the two parties notices its presence. This is done by encrypting and decrypting the data entered before it even reaches the desired destination, monitoring and even stealing this information. This third party impersonates the actual website to decieve the user into trusting it. Humans are easy to fool, but how does my browser allow this? For a website to be deemed trustworthy, it should provide actual physical documentation to attest to that fact like addresses, phone numbers, and so on, in order attain a security certification from a 'CA', which is a credible institution that signs its credibility onto those security certifications it issues. Similar to the DMV, where specific paperwork must be presented to be able to receive a license. This helps build trust and increase security on the web because of the known reputation of these institutions. Yet, there are vulnerabilities. These third parties fabricate the required security certification of the website in order to decieve both sides into thinking they've established a secure connection. Conveniently, this could be described as "MITM", short for 'man in the middle' (man-in-the-middle attack, n.d). This is a type of cyberattack where a third party places itself in between the user and the server. With this, credentials, passwords, and sensitive information is no longer safe. This presents many risks, such as unauthorized money transfers, identity theft and so on. </p> 


<p> 	  That sounds terrifying, and it gets worse. SSL interception cannot be prevented, but it can be detected. When SSL interception is occuring, the 'fake' certificate issued to you by the snooping proxy is going to be different than that of the original website. It is impossible to fake the certificate without having the true private key. Each website's fingerprint is easily accessible and comparing it to the fake one will easy reveal the trick. No one is right 100% of the time, so a false-negative or a false-positive might occur. A false-negative is when an individual comes to the conclusion that they aren't being intercepted when in fact they are. However, a false-postitive is when this individual is being intercepted after concluding that they aren't. This could be a result of reading the wrong name, missing a spelling error ...
</p>
<p>
	A 'hash', which is not remotely similar to the '#' used in social media, is the product after data undergoes a complex math algorithm that cannot be decrypted (Zola A., 2021). A "good hash" will have four essential qualitites: It uses all the input data, it is solely determined by the data being hashed, it generates completely different hashes for similar dara, and it distributes the data across the whole set of hash EQUALLY (Hash Tables: Hash Functions, n.d).
</p>
<p>	Finally, in the current world, each and every web search, texts, and online posts are monitored. Personally, I think the government specifically, should monitor devices, but with control, even though many shootings that have happened in the past have been posted about before happening. Regarding the workplace and schools, I think people are going to find other ways to access these 'blocked' websites, so I don't think it is necessary. Plus, it isn't like an individual can be charged or found guilty over an angry text without actually commiting the action.

    <h3>1. What are the two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection? </h3>

    <p> The two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection include the safe transfer of information online by encrypting the data in a way no one can figure out the credentials being entered except the recieving end. This leads to more work and transactions being done online, which can save many tedious costs like offices, office supplies... </p>
    
      <h3>2. What is an HTTPS Proxy Appliance? </h3>

<p> It is similar to a third party acting in between the client/user and the server. Neither of the two parties can detect its presence. It encrypts and decrypts the data sent from the browser, monitoring it, although its real job should be validating the digital certificates to establish a secure connection while keeping the data encrypted/secure. In reality, they just create fake security certifications in order to decieve both sides into thinking they have a secure connection.</p>
      
<h3>3. What is MITM?  What risks does this present? </h3>

<p> An MITM, short for "man in the middle", is a type of cyberattack where as the name states, a third party places itself in between the user/client and the server the user wishes to reach securely, sometimes even pretending to be the desired website. With this, this third party can moniter, steal, and collect the information being exchanged such as credentials, passwords, and sensitive personal information. This presents many risks, such as unauthorized money transfers, identity theft ... </p>

	  <h3>4. What is a hash? What are the essential qualities that make a hash a "good" hash? </h3>


    <p> A hash is the result of data going through a complex math algorithm and becoming a string that cannot be decrpyted. It is mainly used to create hash tables, which make finding specific information in huge data bases much easier. They are stored as keys and assigned value pairs. The key is put into the hashing function as input and it helps recognize the data.Then the resulting hash code is mapped to a certain size. <br>
    A "good hash" will have four essential qualities: It uses all the input data, it is solely determined by the data being hashed, it generates completely different hashes for similar data, and it distributes the data across the whole set of hash value EQUALLY. </p>
	  
	  <h3> 5. What is a CA? What role do they play? </h3>


<p>It is a trusted institute to whom web sites prove their security/credibility/identity in the real world using physical documentation, addresses, phone numbers.... in order to get a signed security certification. This is helpful since web browsers trust these certifications to ensure secure encrypted data. It's similar to the DMV where you have to present physical evidence to get your license. In this case, the license would be the signed security certification after presenting all the paperwork deeming you fit/worthy. This helps ensure security on the web since these are trusted and credible institutions. </p>
	  
	  <h3>6. How can SSL interception be prevented? </h3>


<p> SSL interception can't be prevented per say, but it can be detected. </p>
	  
	  <h3>7. How can SSL interception be detected?</h3>


<p> If SSL interception is happening, then the 'fake' certificate issued to you by the snooping proxy is going to be different than the original one since it is impossible to fake the ceritificate without having the private key (The private key is very private and secure information). Each website's fingerprint is easily accessible and will be very different than that of a fake one.  </p>
	  
	  <h3>8. What is a false-positive? What is a false-negative? </h3>

<p> A false positive is when you think you're being intercepted, but you are actually not and may be comparing the wrong name. A false-negative is when you believe you aren't being intercepted when in fact you are.  </p>

	  <h3>9. Does your school / government / ISP have a right to eavesdrop on your communications? </h3>

<p> I value my privacy and believe everyone deserves privacy. Hiding behind the 'security' excuse would be embarrasing because many shootings have been reported online before happening. You can't charge someone because of something they have said online. That in mind, the government specifically, I think should have some type of monitoring power, but WITH CONTROL. </p>
