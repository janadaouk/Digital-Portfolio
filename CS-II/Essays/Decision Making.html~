  <!-- <p> 5 biases:
      + liking someones ideas because of the person proposing them instead of because of the idea itself
      + act quickly rather than taking time to think decision through
      + Choosing the easier option
      + Choosing the safer option/ not willing to try something new bcz of lack of knowledge\
      + Peer pressure/time constricts/ stress-->


    <p>  Working independently is appealing to many, but collaboration is often required to produce a more mature and diversified result. However, the issue of decision making and the biases that may occur, compromising the integrity of creating the best possible product arises. Tackling five biases I think may occur while completing my ISP project with a group, I plan to elaborate on them and discuss possible solutions to each one respectively.   </p>
       
      
    <h5> Safety Bias </h5>

    <p>  The fear of failure is prominent in modern day society, driving some decisions to rely on subjective feelings instead of objective facts. This self-sabotage method is very common as students opt to do something they are already familiar with instead of asking help and attempting something new. This may drive the objective of the project away from the intended goal, which is to grow and gain NEW skills. By opting to select the safer option, one would be limiting their opportunities to grow. This bias stems from laziness, the lack of academic curiosity, and fear. To overcome this bias in my group, I will be sure to ask myself before taking any decisions, whether that decision supports improvement or not. I will be observant to detect whether the decisions being made aren't being made out of safety bias. I will also be sure to communicate efficiently with my group members about any concerns I have.  </p>
      

     <h5> Easier Option Bias </h5>

    <p>  As with the Safety bias, this bias stems from the same three diseases that affect people negatively on the daily: laziness, the lack of academic curiosity, and fear. People often tend to accept their current skill level and only accomplish ideas that are within their knowledge. Why bother to put the extra effort into something more complex when there is an easier option type of mentality. It is argued that it isn't out of laziness that humans automatically pick the easiet option available, but rather that "humans naturally pick the path of least resistance," (Hartwell, 2021). To avoid this issue, I will make sure to reach to an agreement with my group members regarding the academic goals they have set to gain from this project and working around that as we make collaborative decisions.   </p>

     <h5> Impulsive/Quick Decision Bias </h5>

   <p>   This bias is especially eminent as many students do not wish to take the time to think a decision through. They often end up choosing based on a whim. This leads to ineffective, unresearched, and simply poor decisions. An impulsive decision is a risk one that prioritizes immediate rewards despite potential long-term negative consequences (Martin & Potts, 2009). Taking the time to decide what is best, depending on abilities, recourses, and time constraints lead to a well thought out decision that one could actually execute and follow through on. Taking these impulsive decisions causes more damage than good, as one will probably end up going back on that decision because of an obstacle, which could easily have been avoided, had the decision been thought through and studied. To avoid such an issue, when taking group decisions, it will be important for the proposers of each idea to have researched and studied their respective proposals, clearing them of any issues that may arise if executed. It is also equally important that the group listens to one another and thinks about the issue from an objective standpoint. Making pros and cons lists, as well as discussing the options will help to avoid this bias in my group. </p>  
      
     <h5> Circumstance Bias </h5>

 <p>  Being told not to stress about matters that stress you out doesn't work. Being stressed affects one's life negatively in many different aspects. Not only that, but this type of bias also includes time constraints that may cause pressure and tension, resulting in inaccurate decisions, as "Cognitive regidity gets amplified by time pressure, negative emotions, exhaustion, and negative emotions" (Mankins et al., 2021). Pressure from peers and the fear of judgment also affects one's decisions. Stress "[limits] the ability to make novel decisions and adapt to change", leading to ineffective and poor decision making (n.a, 2022). The circumstances in one's life will always affect their decisions, so being able to separate your personal life from your proffesional life is important. One must consistenlty try to remain objective while making decisions, and that is what my group will do. We will try to think objectively and realistically about the deadline, not allowing the stress to hault our progress. </p>

<h5> Personal Bias </h5>

  <p> Personal bias occurs when one's popularity amongst the majority plays a role in the decision making process. Whether it be a grudge, racism, an act of discrimination, or a specific person is favored over another, decisions that are made because of this are usually flawed. The decision being taken should be taken solely based off what is best for the project as a whole, not the person who proposed it. For the best possible result, that is the way the decision should be taken. In my group, to avoid such an issue, we will vote on all major decisions to insure the absence of personal bias. My group is originally not a friend group, so diverse opinions will be shared and biased group votes will be easily avoided due to that.    </p>

  <p> In addition to all the specific methods to avoid these types of bias, it is important to remember the general rules to avoid these conflicts: being respectful while disagreeing to someone's proposal, choosing language carefully when comparing ideas, utilizing inclusive pronouns instead of personal ones, being mindful to include everyone in the project, respecting others's opinions without judgement... </p>
