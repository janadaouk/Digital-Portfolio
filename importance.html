    <h2> Why My Digital Portfolio Is Important To Me? </h2>
    
    <p id="imp"> With Cs getting more competitive, actually showing potential universities and employers what I have accomplished and my abilities will benefit me greatly. Especially since computer sceince is something I will encounter in every field, I may even end up in a computer science major. I also believe it is important to keep track of past projects incase I need to refer back. It's also a  great way for me to track my progress and growth. I also get to be creative with it, which is cool. Plus, it'll be really pretty eventually (don't procrastinate until Wednesday night).  </p>
