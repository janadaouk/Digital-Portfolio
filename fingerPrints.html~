    <h3>1. What are the two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection? </h3>

    <p> The two primary purposes of a secure, HTTPS connection include the safe transfer of information online by encrypting the data in a way no one can figure out the credentials being entered except the recieving end. This leads to more work and transactions being done online, which can save many tedious costs like offices, office supplies... </p>
    
      <h3>2. What is an HTTPS Proxy Appliance? </h3>

<p> It is similar to a third party acting in between the client/user and the server. Neither of the two parties can detect its presence. It encrypts and decrypts the data sent from the browser, monitoring it, although its real job should be validating the digital certificates to establish a secure connection while keeping the data encrypted/secure. In reality, they just create fake security certifications in order to decieve both sides into thinking they have a secure connection.</p>
      
<h3>3. What is MITM?  What risks does this present? </h3>

<p> An MITM, short for "man in the middle", is a type of cyberattack where as the name states, a third party places itself in between the user/client and the server the user wishes to reach securely, sometimes even pretending to be the desired website. With this, this third party can moniter, steal, and collect the information being exchanged such as credentials, passwords, and sensitive personal information. This presents many risks, such as unauthorized money transfers, identity theft ... </p>

	  <h3>4. What is a hash? What are the essential qualities that make a hash a "good" hash? </h3>


    <p> A hash is the result of data going through a complex math algorithm and becoming a string that cannot be decrpyted. <br>
    A "good hash" will have four essential qualities: It uses all the input data, it is solely determined by the data being hashed, it generates completely different hashes for similar data, and it distributes the data across the whole set of hash value EQUALLY. </p>
	  
	  <h3> 5. What is a CA? What role do they play? </h3>


<p>It is a trusted institute to whom web sites prove their security/credibility/identity in the real world using physical documentation, addresses, phone numbers.... in order to get a signed security certification. This is helpful since web browsers trust these certifications to ensure secure encrypted data. It's similar to the DMV where you have to present physical evidence to get your license. In this case, the license would be the signed security certification after presenting all the paperwork deeming you fit/worthy. This helps ensure security on the web since these are trusted and credible institutions. </p>
	  
	  <h3>6. How can SSL interception be prevented? </h3>


<p> SSL interception can't be prevented per say, but it can be detected. </p>
	  
	  <h3>7. How can SSL interception be detected?</h3>


<p> If SSL interception is happening, then the 'fake' certificate issued to you by the snooping proxy is going to be different than the original one since it is impossible to fake the ceritificate without having the private key (The private key is very private and secure information). Each website's fingerprint is easily accessible and will be very different than that of a fake one.  </p>
	  
	  <h3>8. What is a false-positive? What is a false-negative? </h3>

<p> A false positive is when you think you're being intercepted, but you are actually not and may be comparing the wrong name. A false-negative is when you believe you aren't being intercepted when in fact you are.  </p>

	  <h3>9. Does your school / government / ISP have a right to eavesdrop on your communications? </h3>

<p> I value my privacy and believe everyone deserves privacy. Hiding behind the 'security' excuse would be embarrasing because many shootings have been reported online before happening. You can't charge someone because of something they have said online. That in mind, the government specifically, I think should have some type of monitoring power, but WITH CONTROL. </p>
