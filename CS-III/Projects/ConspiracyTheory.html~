    In this digital age, one finds themself in a vicious cycle of consummation. Whether that be of content like videos, ads, news, theories, or products. These recommendations found on the screen are meant to help personalize what you consume online, but there are important factors to note as to how they work and the effects that they may have, often when exploited.
  </p>
  <p> Recommendation algorithms are used to suggest content or products to users based on different factors. From analyzing what the user consumes to their likes, search inquiries, recent purchases, viewing time, demographic information, and items on one's wish list, these algorithms are in place to lead the user to similar recommendations that align with their interests. These recommendations are made based on collected data from the users, making the recommendations personal and tempting. The type of data acquired is what determines the type of algorithm used. There are many different types of algorithms. The collaborative filtering algorithm could either be user-based or Item-based. This type of filtering is done using data from collecting the preferences of many users (hence the collaborative). The item-based algorithm recommends items that are similar to the user's own preferences and likes: for example, the items you have recently purchased or are already in your wishlist. However, the user-based algorithm finds users with similar interests and recommends items that the similar users have liked or purchased. Another recommendation algorithm is the content filtering algorithm which uses the item's specific features to recommend similar items based on the user's preferences. This works through the model's analysis of the user and their previous purchases, the genre, type, and category of these items. There are also hybrid algorithms, which are a combination of content and collaborative filtering to ensure more accurate predictions and recommendations. This exploits the strengths of both algorithms to make a more educated recommendation based on both the users and the item, ultimately driving up the success rate of the algorithm. Looking at another type is the context filtering algorithm which uses the user's contextual information to produce the recommendations. It relies on a sequence of contextual user actions in order to best make a prediction and ultimately the probability of the user's next actions.</p>
  <p> These algorithms work through many different methods. Matrix factorization is one of them, being a core for many of the popular algorithms like word-embedding and topic modeling. It has become a dominant method within collaborative filtering algorithm recommendations. It can be used to calculate the similarity between user's ratings or interactions in order to spit out recommendations. Using the ALS (alternating least squares) algorithm or the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) algorithm, hidden patterns used to produce recommendations are found in the data. Deep Neural Network models are another way these algorithms function. Deep Learning models use neural networks to find complex patterns and relationships in large data sets. They enhance recommendation systems by better personalizing the recommendations through the capture of nuanced use behavior. They analyze complicated user behavior and the item's features in order to find patterns and draw clear relations. However Contextual Sequence Learning makes sure to take into consideration the specific sequence and the context of the data. So it takes into consideration each of the different elements and their respective relevances. It then begins to recognize and learn complex patterns in the sequential data in order to produce more accurate predictions for user recommendations.</p>
  <p>The Feedback loop is an important part of the algorithm in which some or all of the system's output is used as input for future operations. As it is named the feedback loop, it retains feedback, creating a self-enforcing loop where the program continually uses the feedback to develop and learn. It first collects the data, analyzes it, and produces recommendations based on the analysis. It is a continuous process, where the recommendations change based on the input or feedback analyzed. It is ever-changing and continuous, crucial for the recommendations to remain relevant. This may have a negative effect of encouraging the user's bias and recommendations to a specific area, reducing the diversity of the recommendations. </p>
  <p> An interesting perspective on the matter is the direct influence these algorithms have on conspiracy theories and the attention they get. Conspiracy theories and algorithmic amplification have a direct relationship in today's age as Social media platforms and online algorithms can have the result of amplifying conspiracy theories and misinformation unintentionally. Social media platforms mostly use algorithms that prioritize content based on user's engagement. Because of the absurdity, interesting views, and peculiar ideas most often present in conspiracy theories, they will elicit the most engagement from users. Conspiracy theories about outrageous assumptions that engage the audience's emotions also elicit strong engagement with the content. This unintentionally leads to amplifying and spreading the conspiracy theories. Not only that but the filter bubble and echo chamber effect, which are both caused by recommendation algorithms not providing a diversity of content, lead to validating bias in the benefit of the user. When it comes to conspiracy theories, the more they are exposed to this type of content, the more related content will continue to bombard the user, clouding their judgment.</p>
  <p> These algorithms are based on a factor that makes them a vulnerable target to exploit. Because of the algorithms that are based on the user's engagement with the content, this will act as an incentive to spark engagement. Moreover, because of the standard and recommendations being set based on user engagement and not factuality nor quality of the content, this could lead to the promotion of misinformation and false news instead of factual content. Conspiracy theories, being not factual information usually spread because of their intriguing premise because of how the recommendation algorithms work. However, the incentives of most platforms are to increase revenue through that increased engagement leading to a cross-roads.</p>
  <p> Finally, it is important to note that because of how these algorithms are set up, they are vulnerable to exploitation from malicious persons. Through the spread of misinformation and outrageous conspiracy theories that spark powerful emotions and engagement, they are able to hit high engagement rates. Fake accounts and bots could be created to inflate the popularity of conspiracy theories in order to boost the engagement. Exploiting the algorithm's preference for high-engagement content, the spread of conspiracy theories becomes a tempting endeavor.</p>
