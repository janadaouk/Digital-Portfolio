    <h3> Concept: </h3>
	    <p> This experience was definitely a beneficial one as I collaborated with 2 of my classmates to create a videogame in swift. As our school blocks many games available online. The google chrome dinosaur game never let us down, so building off of this, we created a similar game. The main avatar ‘princess avocado’ must get through vegetable obstacles in order to save prince lettuce. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
	    <h3> Motivation: </h3>
    <p> The grade at the end of the semester definitely not being a huge motivation, we wanted to make a game about vegetables because we thought it would be fun and creative.  </p>
      </li>
      <li>
    <h3>Code Segments: </h3>
    <p id="func" > // function to play StartSound and then start the game <br>
      func startGame(to canvas: Canvas) { <br>
      if startGame && startsound.isready { <br>
      canvas.render(startsound) <br>
      print("switching to game") <br>
    switchToGame()
    } <br>
    } <br> </p>
    <p> We used this code to run some soundeffects during the game. We also called the scene transition inside this function. So, if the player clicks sstart, then this function will be called, it makes the track ready, renders it, prints text for debugging, then calls the switchToGame function. That just switches the scenes and allows the game to begin.
      </li>

    <h3> What went wrong? </h3>
<p id="last" > Honestly, what didn't go wrong? To be fair, we did face many challenges, had to modify a few ideas to fit the timeline and our abilities, but we ended up with a game I was actually satisfied with. We even added extra ideas at some point.  </p>
